basic window management using Mjolnir
I've got three monitors and put everything in the foreground
so I have two major uses for this:

1. Keyboard shortcut to go to nearby windows
  I use Ctrl-Shift HJKL, because Ctrl HJKL moves between tmux splits
2. Keyboard shortcut to maximize window on a screen
  cmd-alt 123

Probably need to add something along the lines of "use left half of current monitor"

Install instructions: TODO. Forgot what all I did. Install Lua, Mjolnir, and the things listed in init.lua
